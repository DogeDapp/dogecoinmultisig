DOGECOINMULTISIG -  A bunch of wallets and mini-programs and tools

***********************************************************************************************************

*Multiple wallet designs pare down to a single withdraw functionality.* The withdraw is broken down into several of the dogecoin network's principal components, allowing the user to verify at each step of the dogecoin-sending process (creating transaction, signing(s), broadcast). This information is also logged in the console (F12 on most browsers). #educational

Here's a Quick Pictorial Guide (ELI5) for the above functionality: https://imgur.com/a/fka37.

The first wallet was the Dogecoin Banking Suite. Over time, more wallets and other functionalities accumulated onto the site. 

TripleShibe is a functionality requiring 3 public keys, in order to preside over various types of multisigs (1/1, 1/2, 2/2, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3), these are controlled by 3 WIF (Private) Keys.

Quatroshibe is a functionality requiring 4 public keys, providing access to various x/4 multisigs.

P.S.: If it's a large transaction (over 3K or so), you might get a 'Too Big for Browser'-type error. In that case, you'll need to copy/paste the transaction, from signer to signer, and then copy/paste again to broadcast. It's a little more cumbersome, yes. But it works.
